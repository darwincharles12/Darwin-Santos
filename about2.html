                <h1>About our <span>Resturant</span></h1>
                <p>August 20, 1985, the Filipino Delicacies Dessert opened it's first physical store in Sta. Rosa Laguna serving different kind of delicacies that can be found in the Philippines. The fist menu of our restaurant is puto binan, kutsinta, leche flan, ube halaya, and the famous halo-halo(edit). For the past 15 years, we added a lot of filipino delicacies in our menu and the demand becomes higher. Our store developed 10 branches all over the Philippines; Manila, Bicol, Davao, Occidental Mindoro, Tarlac, Batangas, Cavite, Rizal, and Quezon. In our store, we serve highly tested products and uses 100% organic products. We are also plastic free and uses traditional method in preparing kakanin. In preparing kakanin, we use palayok in cooking, some of the kakanin cook more or less than 15 minutes and some are not. We serve it hot in a palm of the banana tree. The founder of this store is Leonora Leondora, she is a filipino-spanish who fell inlove in cooking filipino kakanin. At the age of 18, she built a store named "Leonora kakanin" (picture ulit gawin na lang medieval style yung edit)she said, at first, her store doesn't that famous. Sometimes, there's no customers in the whole day until she improve the menu. Leonora Leondora died in 2010 because of cancer. Until now, we maintain our delicious and traditional way of cooking kakanin for us to look back for what we've had in the old times.</p>

                <h1>Puto Bumbong</h1>
                <p>Puto Bumbong: Filipino purple rice cakes called puto bumbong are made by heating a mixture of pulverized purple rice within a bamboo tube. In Filipino, the tube is referred to as "bumbong ng kawayan." This may have served as inspiration for the name.
                    <br><br><span>Recipe:</span>
                    <br>1 1/3 cups sticky purple rice
                    <br>1 1/3 cups glutinous white rice malagkit
                    <br>2/3 cup long grain purple rice
                    <br>6 cups water for soaking the rice
                    <br>3/4 cups muscovado sugar
                    <br>1 1/2 cups freshly grated coconut
                    <br>1/2 cup softened butter
                    <br><br><span>Instructions:</span><br>1. Combine all types of rice in a large mixing bowl. Pour water. Soak for 2 days.
                    <br>2. Drain the water by pouring the contents of the bowl into a large sieve.
                    <br>3. Put the soaked rice in a large food processor. Start to grind the rice until it becomes very fine. Note: It took me around 10 minutes to achieve this consistency.
                    <br>4. Fill your puto bumbong steamer with water halfway through. Apply heat and then let the water boil.
                    <br>5. Meanwhile, fill each bumbong (bamboo tube) with powdered rice. Note: Do not compress the rice so that steam can pass easily.
                    <br>6.Once the water starts to boil rapidly, arrange each bamboo tube on the steamer. Continue to cook until steam comes out of the tube.
                    <br>7. Remove the tube from the steamer. Arrange the contents over a piece of banana leaf. Spread butter all over and then top with freshly grated coconut and muscovado sugar.
                    <br>8. Serve. Share and enjoy!</p>

                <p>Christmas is the only holiday that Filipinos cherish as much as food. Christmas is so cherished in the Philippines that our holiday season really starts on September 1!

During the holiday season, we can find bibingka being sold by street vendors, particularly close to churches, as the well-known Ben & Ben song of the same name claims.

                <h1>Bibingka Malagkit Biko</h1>
                <p> Do you enjoy eating rice cakes? If you enjoyed biko and suman, you'll adore this recipe for Bibingkang Malagkit, a sticky rice cake. This may resemble the mouthwatering bibingka that is sold at simbang gabi, but it is very different. Bibingkang Malagkit can be regarded as both a dessert and a snack. It is occasionally had for breakfast together with brewed coffee (or kapeng barako). This tutorial will make it simple for you to complete the required procedures even though the process of producing this delicious rice cake is relatively difficult and time-consuming.
                <br><br><span>Recipe:</span>
                <br>6 cups coconut milk
                <br>3 cups glutinous rice, washed
                <br>1 1/2cup brown sugar
                <br>1 tsp salt
                <br>Banana Leaves
                <br>For Toppings
                <br>2 1/2 cups Coconut Cream (Latik)
                <br>1 cup Brown Sugar
                <br>½ tsp salt
                <br><br><span>Instructions:</span>
                <br>In a pot combine glutinous rice and 6 cups of coconut milk and bring to a boil then reduce heat to low.
                Simmer gently while occasionally mixing to cook them evenly and not burn the bottom, let the mixture thicken until it’s nearly dried out.
                Add sugar and salt then mix continuously on medium-low heat for 10 minutes.
                At this stage, it will be really sticky.
                Line a 9x 13 baking tray with banana leaf then transfer the cooked glutinous rice. Set it aside.
                Prepare your topping by mixing all topping ingredients together in a pan, bring it to a boil and simmer on medium heat uncovered until heavily reduced but still runny.
                Pour topping over the rice cake on the baking pan then bake in a 180C preheated oven for 20 minutes or until topping becomes really thick and dark (not burnt).
                Remove from oven and set it aside to cool down.
                Serve.

                <h1>Bilobilo</h1>
                <p>Bilo-Bilo: A popular Filipino delicacy is called Ginataang Bilo-bilo with Langka. It is made up of ripe jackfruit, coconut cream, sugar, sago pearls, and glutinous rice balls (called as bilo-bilo in the local dialect). When the glutinous rice balls and the sago are prepared, cooking this dish is fairly simple. Some people view it as a simplified version of the Ginataang halo-halo. There is some boiling, stirring, and mixing involved in the procedure. In no time at all, you should be able to enjoy your delectable Filipino snack. The first step is to bring water to a boil in a pot. When the water is boiling, add the coconut cream. Add sugar and stir. 
                <br><br><span>Recipe:</span> 
                <br>20 pieces glutinous rice balls (Bilo-bilo)

                Gradually stir-in the sugar.
                Add the ripe jackfruit. Cover and cook in low heat for 15 minutes.
                Add-in the bilo-bilo. Continue to cook for another 15 minutes while stirring every 3 minutes.
                Put-in the sago. Cook for 3 to 5 minutes.
                Transfer to a serving bowl. Serve.

                <p>Kutsinta : A form of "kakanin" that incorporates lye water is kutsinta, kuchinta, or even brown rice cake. Kutsinta tastes finest when eaten with shredded coconut since it is chewy and slightly sticky at the same time (lye water makes things that way). The steps in this kutsinta recipe are quite simple to follow and require very little effort. This would be a pretty good recipe worth attempting if you were thinking about creating anything for merienda. The ideal way to serve kutsinta is with grated coconut on top. This is also one of the most well-known Filipino desserts to date.

                <h1>Leche-Flan</h1>
                <p>Leche flan: The best dessert in the Philippines is leche flan. Without it, the dining table will fall short, especially during festive occasions like parties and town fiestas. A soft caramel topping is placed on top of the egg-and-milk dish known as leche flan. It resembles caramel custard and crème caramel. Due to its popularity, ease of preparation, and lengthy shelf life, this delectable dessert has become a staple on the menus of most restaurants. Additionally, it can be used as a base to create other fantastic dessert creations.
                    <br><br><span>Recipe:</span> 
                    <br>10 pieces eggs
                    <br>1 can condensed milk (14 oz)
                    <br>1 cup fresh milk or evaporated milk
                    <br>1 cup granulated sugar
                    <br>1 teaspoon vanilla extract
                    <br><br><span>Instructions:</span>
                    <br>Using all the eggs, separate the yolk from the egg white (only egg yolks will be used).
                    Place the egg yolks in a big bowl then beat them using a fork or an egg beater
                    Add the condensed milk and mix thoroughly
                    Pour-in the fresh milk and Vanilla. Mix well
                    Put the mold (llanera) on top of the stove and heat using low fire
                    Put-in the granulated sugar on the mold and mix thoroughly until the solid sugar turns into liquid (caramel) having a light brown color. Note: Sometimes it is hard to find a Llanera (Traditional flan mold) depending on your location. I find it more convenient to use individual Round Pans in making leche flan.
                    Spread the caramel (liquid sugar) evenly on the flat side of the mold
                    Wait for 5 minutes then pour the egg yolk and milk mixture on the mold
                    Cover the top of the mold using an Aluminum foil
                    Steam the mold with egg and milk mixture for 30 to 35 minutes.
                    After steaming, let the temperature cool down then refrigerate
                    Serve for dessert. Share and Enjoy!

A mold is used to steam the mixture until a sticky, gelatinous consistency is achieved. It wasn't until a few years ago that I was able to try Pichi-Pichi. This is coated with grated coconut after steaming for added flavor. On special occasions, our office regularly orders this along with Filipino spaghetti and pork barbecue (these are grilled pork slices in skewers). This recipe won't drain your bank account.
                    <br><br><span>Recipe:</span>
                    <br>2 cups cassava grated
                    <br>1 cup sugar
                    <br>2 cups water
                    <br>1 cup coconut grated
                    <br>1/2 tsp lye water
                    <br>1/2 tsp buko-pandan essence
                    <br><br><span>Instructions:</span>
                    <br>In a mixing bowl, combine cassava, sugar, and water then mix thoroughly
                    Add lye water while continuously stirring the mixture
                    Put-in the buko-pandan essence then mix again
                    Once the mixture is evenly distributed, pour in individual cup molds and place in a steamer
                    Steam the mixture for 45 minutes to 1 hour (or until the color turns translucent)
                    Allow the steamed pichi-pichi to cool down (at least 40 minutes to 1 hour ; you can even place it in the fridge after letting it cool down at least 15 minutes) then remove from the molds
                    Roll the each piece over the grated coconut
                    Place in a serving plate then serve. Share and Enjoy!

                <p>Puto: The Puto recipe that is shaped like cupcakes and with a log of cheese on top is the most popular. Puto is available in a range of flavors and hues. The Cheese Flavored Puto and the Salted Egg-Topped Puto are the most well-liked varieties. In the Philippines, puto may be served on special occasions with just the groove remaining and no cheese on top. In a way, it is amusing because the kids, who don't like to eat a lot, take the cheese but skip the Puto. The savory puto with slivers of salted egg on top is another variety. Again, once served and unattended in some homes, the toppings may disappear.

                <h1>Sapin Sapin</h1>
                <p>Sapin-sapin: Filipino rice cakes called sapin sapin are made from sticky rice and coconut milk. The layers of this delectable sapin sapin dish each have a distinct hue and flavor. The three layers of sapin-sapin are typical; the bottom layer is yellow and tastes like ripe jackfruit, the middle layer is white and tastes like young coconut or just plain coconut milk, and the top layer is violet and tastes like purple yam.
                    <br><br><span>Recipe:</span>
                    <br>2 cups glutinous rice flour
                    <br>4 cups coconut milk
                    <br>1 cup granulated white sugar
                    <br>7 oz. 1/2 can condensed milk
                    <br>1/2 cup ripe jackfruit
                    <br>3/4 cup mashed purple yam
                    <br>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
                    <br>1/4 teaspoon ube extract
                    <br>1 tablespoon cooking oil or coconut oil
                    <br>Violet food coloring
                    <br>Yellow food coloring
                    <br>1/4 cup latik
                    <br><br><span>Instructions:</span>
                    <br>In a large mixing bowl, combine glutinous rice flour and sugar. Mix well.
                    Pour-in the condensed milk, coconut milk, and vanilla extract. Mix until the texture becomes smooth.
                    Divide the mixture into 3 parts.
                    Add the mashed purple yam and ube extract on the first part along with the violet food coloring. Stir thoroughly and then set aside.
                    Shred the jackfruit (without the seed) in a food processor. Add the processed jackfruit on the second part along with the yellow coloring and then mix well. Set aside. Note: leave the 3rd part as it is.
                    Arrange the steamer on your stovetop and pour-in about 1 quart of water. Turn on the heat and let the water boil.
                    Grease a round baking pan by brushing cooking oil or coconut oil.
                    Pour-in the first part (colored violet) on the greased baking pan. Make sure that the mixture settles. Cover the baking pan with a cheesecloth and then steam for 12 to 16 minutes.
                    Remove the baking pan and then pour-in the white mixture. Use a spatula to spread it on top of the violet mixture. Remove excess water from the cheesecloth by squeezing it. Put it back on the baking pan. Steam for another 12 to 16 minutes.
                    Remove the baking pan from the steamer and then pour-in the yellow mixture. Spread the mixture over the succeeding one using a spatula. Try to remove the excess water again from the cloth and then put it back on the baking pan. Steam for 15 to 20 minutes. Note: If you think that the mixture is still a bit runny, try to steam for 5 minutes more.
                    Arrange a clean banana leaf over a wide serving plate. Brush coconut or cooking oil on the leaf. Use a spatula (brushed with oil) and gently run on the side of the baking pan to prevent the mixture from sticking. Turn the baking pan over the banana leaf and let the cooked sapin-sapin fall.
                    Brush oil on top of the sapin-sapin (the violet part should be on top). Sprinkle with latik.
                    Serve for dessert. Share and enjoy!
